# Customer Conversion Prediction
## Background
You are working for a new-age insurance company and employ mutiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to your customers. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people however they incur a lot of cost. Hence, it is important to identify the customers that are most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. We are given the historical marketing data of the insurance company and are required to build a ML model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance.
## Goals of this project
1. Analyze how various features influence the telephonic marketing campaign.
2. Help Insurance company improves their efficiency.
3. Develop Machine Learning Models that can help insurance company to predict response of customers.

## Some Conclusions
### Various factors can influence the customers response to  insurance company telephonic marketing. From the analysis in this project we can conclude that
* Customers with different age and diferent occupation have different response to telephone marketing campaign. Middle aged people has least interest. Early age people like students, old age people (retired people) have more willingness. So insurance company can focus on these customers so they can get higher conversion rate.
* Education matters, people with primary education are more likely to give negatie response to marketing campaign. Higher the education, higher the positive response. Insurance company can focus on customers whoare highly educated i.e post secondary education.
* In March,May,April, December,JUly we have higher conversion rate, which can be due to end of financial year, returning to home from summer holdays or winter holidays- customers try to save after their trips.
